## Backend

Backend was created with

### Framework

#### `npm init`

All backend contents resides in the `backend` folder.<br />

Afterwards installing Express, Cors and other dependencies.
Check dependency section of **package.json** for more details

### Database

MongoDB Cluster0 was used here with Application interfacing through `.env` file. The file was removed because it was conflicting with Github security policy.

## Frontend

Project frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
